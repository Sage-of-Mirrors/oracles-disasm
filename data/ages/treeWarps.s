; This is a list of positions Link can warp to with gale seeds.
; This does not populate the screens themselves with trees or anything.
;
; Each time period should have exactly 8 entries. To add more, it is necessary to modify
; the "_galeSeedMenu_addOffsetToWarpIndex" function, and perhaps others.
;
; Data format:
;   b0: room index (or $00 to terminate the list)
;   b1: position for Link to land in
;   b2: map popup index (should show the tree type)
