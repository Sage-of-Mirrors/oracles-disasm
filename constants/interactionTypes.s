; This is a list of all interactions in the game.
;
; The comments here should describe the "interface" of the objects; that is, what
; variables are important to initialize when creating them. Additional comments about
; internal variables used by the objects may be found next to their code (search for
; a label of the form "interactionCodeXX", where XX is their ID).
;
; COMMENT FORMAT:
;   LynnaLab parses the comments to glean information about interactions. When a line
;   starts with ";;", every subsequent line that starts with ";" is considered
;   documentation until the next uncommented line. Within here, the description can be
;   typed, or fields can be entered with "@field{value}".
;
;   Field list (case-insensitive):
;   * postype: Affects how to determine the object's position.
;       "normal" = Y and X positions are treated normally (default).
;       "short" = both Y and X positions are stored in Y variable.
;       "none" = this object doesn't have anything resembling a position.
;   * palette: Palette header to load. Most sprites use palettes 0-5, which are always the
;              same, but some object use slots 6-7 for custom palettes. These objects
;              should use this field.
;
;  You might also see some manual newline ("\n") entries sometimes since making the
;  comments pretty in both the GUI and in plaintext format is hard...
;
; USING THIS WITH ZOLE:
;   To use this with ZOLE, first find the main ID of the object you want (on the .define
;   line), then check the comments to see if you want a particular subID.
;
;   Then, in ZOLE, create a "no-value interaction" or a "2-value interaction" with ID
;   XXYY, where XX is the main ID, and YY is the subid. (Use $00 if no subids are
;   specified.)
;
;   Example: INTERACID_DUNGEON_STUFF has subid $01, which drops a small key when all
;   enemies are killed. You would create an interaction with ID 1201.
;
;   If you also need to set var03, create a "Quadruple-value object" instead.  Set "Type"
;   to 0 (means "interaction"), and set "Unknown" to the value you need for var03.
